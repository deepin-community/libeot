This library makes use of information patented by Microsoft and Monotype Imaging.
I, the developer of this library, have made a good-faith effort to verify that this library does not infringe on intellectual property law, in view of Microsoft and Monotype's patent grants associated with their submission of the EOT format to W3C, as described here: http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/01/

I am reasonably sure that this library does not violate the intellectual property laws of my jurisdiction (Arizona, United States). However, I am not a legal expert, so I cannot be perfectly certain. Users of this library are responsible for verifying that it complies with all applicable laws. I absolve myself of any responsibility in this area.
